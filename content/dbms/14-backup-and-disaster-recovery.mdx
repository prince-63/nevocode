# Backup & Disaster Recovery

Data is one of the most valuable assets of any organization. Losing critical data due to hardware failures, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters can be catastrophic. This is why having a well-planned backup and disaster recovery strategy is essential.

## What is Database Backup?

A database backup is a copy of data that can be used to restore the database in case of failure or corruption. Regular backups ensure data integrity and minimize downtime in case of an unexpected event.

## Types of Database Backups

There are several types of database backups, including:

1. **Full Backup**: A complete backup of the entire database.

2. **Differential Backup**: A backup of all changes made since the last full backup.

3. **Incremental Backup**: A backup of all changes made since the last backup, whether full or incremental.

4. **Transaction Log Backup**: A backup of the transaction log, which allows for point-in-time recovery.

## Backup Strategies

Choosing the right backup strategy depends on factors such as the size of the database, the recovery time objective (RTO), and the recovery point objective (RPO). Some common backup strategies include:

1. **3-2-1 Backup Rule**: Keep at least three copies of your data, store them on two different types of media, and keep one copy offsite.

2. **Automated Backups**: Schedule regular backups to run automatically.

3. **Cloud Backups**: Store backups in the cloud for added redundancy and disaster recovery.

4. **On-Premise Backups vs. Offsite Backups**: A combination of local and offsite storage provides better protection against disasters.

## What is Disaster Recovery?

Disaster recovery (DR) is a structured approach to restoring database functionality after an incident such as hardware failure, cyberattacks, or natural disasters. The goal is to minimize downtime and data loss.

## Disaster Recovery Planning

A disaster recovery plan outlines the steps to be taken to recover from a disaster and restore database functionality. Key components of a disaster recovery plan include:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks and their impact on the database.

2. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Define the maximum acceptable downtime for the database.

3. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Define the maximum acceptable data loss in case of a disaster.

4. **Backup and Recovery Procedures**: Document backup strategies and recovery procedures.

5. **Testing and Maintenance**: Regularly test the disaster recovery plan and update it as needed.

## Disaster Recovery Techniques

Different techniques can be used to implement disaster recovery, including:

1. **Replication**: Maintaining a synchronized copy of the database at a remote location.
2. **High Availability**: Using redundant systems to ensure continuous availability of the database.
3. **Geo-Redundancy**: Storing backups in multiple geographic locations to protect against regional disasters.
