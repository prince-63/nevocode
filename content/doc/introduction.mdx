# Introduction to C Programming üöÄ

## What is C?

C is a **general-purpose, procedural programming language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1972** at Bell Labs. It is one of the oldest programming languages that still plays a significant role in modern software development. C provides low-level access to memory, making it ideal for **system programming, operating systems, and embedded systems**.

## Why Learn C? üßê

- **Foundation for Other Languages** ‚Äì C influences many modern languages like **C++, Java, Python, and Go**.
- **High Performance** ‚Äì Used in systems where speed is critical (OS kernels, databases, embedded systems).
- **Low-Level Access** ‚Äì Provides direct memory manipulation with **pointers**.
- **Portability** ‚Äì C programs can run on different architectures with minimal modifications.
- **Used in Real-World Applications** ‚Äì Examples include **Linux kernel, MySQL database, Git, and embedded systems**.

## Setting Up Your C Development Environment üõ†Ô∏è

To start coding in C, you'll need a **compiler** and a **code editor**:

### **1. Install a C Compiler**

Popular C compilers:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** (Recommended) ‚Äì Install via `MinGW` on Windows or using `gcc` on macOS/Linux.
- **Clang** ‚Äì A modern alternative to GCC.
- **MSVC** ‚Äì Microsoft‚Äôs compiler for Windows.

#### **Windows (Using MinGW-W64 & GCC)**

1. Download **MinGW-w64** from [mingw-w64.org](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).
2. Add **GCC** to system PATH.
3. Verify installation:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{"gcc --version"}</CodeBlock>

#### **Linux/macOS (Using GCC)**

Install GCC using:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`sudo apt install gcc # Ubuntu/Debian
yum install gcc # CentOS
brew install gcc # macOS`}
</CodeBlock>

### **2. Install a Code Editor**

- **VS Code** (Recommended) ‚Äì Install C/C++ extension.
- **Code::Blocks** ‚Äì Lightweight IDE for C.
- **CLion** ‚Äì Powerful but paid option.

## Writing Your First C Program ‚úçÔ∏è

Let's write a simple **Hello, World!** program in C.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
printf("Hello, World!")
return 0;
}
`
}

</CodeBlock>

### **Explanation:**

1. `#include <stdio.h>` ‚Äì Includes the standard input/output library.
2. `main()` ‚Äì The starting point of a C program.
3. `printf()` ‚Äì Prints output to the console.
4. `return 0;` ‚Äì Indicates successful execution.

### **Compiling & Running the Program**

#### **For Windows:**

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`- gcc hello.c -o hello.exe
- hello.exe
`}
</CodeBlock>

#### **For macOS/Linux:**

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`- gcc hello.c -o hello
- ./hello`}
</CodeBlock>

## Understanding C Compilation Process ‚öôÔ∏è

C programs undergo the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Handles macros, includes, etc.
2. **Compilation** ‚Äì Translates C code into assembly language.
3. **Assembly** ‚Äì Converts assembly into machine code.
4. **Linking** ‚Äì Combines all object files into an executable.
