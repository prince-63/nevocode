# Control Flow in C++ 🚦

Programming is all about making decisions and repeating tasks efficiently. Imagine you're planning a road trip. You decide when to take a turn, whether to stop for fuel, or if you need to keep driving based on different conditions. Similarly, in C++, we use **control flow statements** to make decisions and repeat actions.

## Conditional Statements 🌟
Conditional statements allow your program to take different actions based on conditions.

## The if Statement – Making Decisions
The `if` statement helps the program decide whether to execute a block of code.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int fuel = 10;
    if (fuel > 5) {
        cout << "Enough fuel, let's keep driving!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

📌 **Output:**  
```
Enough fuel, let's keep driving!
```

**Explanation:** If `fuel` is greater than 5, the message "Enough fuel, let's keep driving!" is printed.

## The if-else Statement – Choosing Between Two Options
What if the fuel is low? We use `if-else` to handle both situations.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int fuel = 3;
    if (fuel > 5) {
        cout << "Enough fuel, let's keep driving!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Low fuel! Time to refuel." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## The if-else-if Ladder – Multiple Conditions
Sometimes, we need to check multiple conditions before deciding.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int temperature = 25;
    if (temperature > 30) {
        cout << "It's too hot!" << endl;
    } else if (temperature > 20) {
        cout << "Nice and warm." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "It's cold! Wear a jacket." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## The switch Statement – Handling Multiple Cases
If you have multiple choices (like a restaurant menu), `switch` makes it cleaner.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int day = 3;
    switch (day) {
        case 1: cout << "Monday"; break;
        case 2: cout << "Tuesday"; break;
        case 3: cout << "Wednesday"; break;
        default: cout << "Invalid day!";
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

📌 **Output:**  
```
Wednesday
```

## Loops 🔁 – Repeating Tasks
Loops help repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it manually.

## The for Loop – Counting Repetitions
Imagine counting 1 to 5:

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        cout << "Counting: " << i << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

📌 **Output:**  
```
Counting: 1
 Counting: 2
 Counting: 3
 Counting: 4
 Counting: 5
```

## The while Loop – Repeat Until a Condition is Met
Think of a car moving until it runs out of fuel.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int fuel = 5;
    while (fuel > 0) {
        cout << "Driving... Fuel left: " << fuel << endl;
        fuel--;
    }
    cout << "Out of fuel!";
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

📌 **Output:**  
```
Driving... Fuel left: 5
 Driving... Fuel left: 4
 Driving... Fuel left: 3
 Driving... Fuel left: 2
 Driving... Fuel left: 1
 Out of fuel!
```

## The do-while Loop – Run at Least Once
A vending machine always gives one attempt before checking if money was inserted.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int attempts = 1;
    do {
        cout << "Attempt " << attempts << ": Trying to enter the password..." << endl;
        attempts++;
    } while (attempts <= 3);
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

📌 **Output:**  
```
Attempt 1: Trying to enter the password...
 Attempt 2: Trying to enter the password...
 Attempt 3: Trying to enter the password...
```
