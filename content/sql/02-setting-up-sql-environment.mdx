# Setting Up SQL Environment

Before you can start working with SQL, you need to set up your SQL environment. This involves installing and configuring a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL and creating a sample database to work with.

## Installing MySQL 

The first step in setting up your SQL environment is to install a DBMS such as MySQL on your local machine. MySQL is popular open-source database management systems that are widely used in the industry.

### Installing MySQL

To install MySQL on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Download the MySQL Community Server from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install MySQL on your machine.
3. During the installation process, you will be prompted to set a root password for the MySQL server. Make sure to choose a strong password and remember it for future use.
4. Once the installation is complete, start the MySQL server and verify that it is running correctly.

## Creating a Sample Database

After installing MySQL, the next step is to create a sample database that you can use to practice your SQL skills. we will create a sample database called **employees** that contains a single table **employees** with the following columns:

- **id** (INT): Unique identifier for each employee.
- **name** (VARCHAR): Name of the employee.
- **department** (VARCHAR): Department in which the employee works.
- **salary** (DECIMAL): Salary of the employee.

To create the employees database and table, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and connect to the MySQL server using the appropriate command-line client (**mysql** for MySQL).
2. Run the following SQL commands to create the employees database and table:

```sql
-- Create a new database called employees
CREATE DATABASE employees;

-- Switch to the employees database
USE employees;

-- Create a new table called employees
CREATE TABLE employees (
  -- Primary key column
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- Name column
  name VARCHAR(50),
  -- Department column
  department VARCHAR(50),
  -- Salary column
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

3. Insert some sample data into the **employees** table to get started:

```sql
-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO
  employees (id, name, department, salary)
VALUES
  (1, 'Alice', 'Engineering', 75000.00),
  (2, 'Bob', 'Marketing', 60000.00),
  (3, 'Charlie', 'Sales', 55000.00);
```

4. Verify that the data has been inserted into the **employees** table by running a SELECT query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

5. You should see the following output, which indicates that the sample data has been successfully inserted into the **employees** table:

| id | name    | department   | salary   |
|----|---------|--------------|----------|
| 1  | Alice   | Engineering  | 75000.00 |
| 2  | Bob     | Marketing    | 60000.00 |
| 3  | Charlie | Sales        | 55000.00 |

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your SQL environment and created a sample database to work with. You are now ready to start practicing your SQL skills and learning more about database management.
