# SQL Clauses

In SQL (Structured Query Language), clauses are used to filter, group, and sort the data retrieved from a database. Clauses are used in conjunction with SQL commands to perform specific operations on the data.

## WHERE Clause

The **WHERE** clause is used to filter records based on a specified condition. It is used to retrieve only those records that satisfy the specified condition. The **WHERE** clause is commonly used with **SELECT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** statements.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > 50000;
```

## GROUP BY Clause

The **GROUP BY** clause is used to group the result set based on one or more columns. It is used in conjunction with aggregate functions like **COUNT**, **SUM**, **AVG**, etc. The **GROUP BY** clause is commonly used with the **SELECT** statement.

```sql
SELECT
  emp_dept,
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  employees
GROUP BY
  emp_dept;
```

## HAVING Clause

The **HAVING** clause is used to filter the result set based on aggregate functions. It is used to filter the groups created by the **GROUP BY** clause. The **HAVING** clause is commonly used with the **SELECT** statement.

```sql
SELECT
  emp_dept,
  AVG(emp_salary)
FROM
  employees
GROUP BY
  emp_dept
HAVING
  AVG(emp_salary) > 50000;
```

> **Note:** The **HAVING** clause is used to filter groups, whereas the **WHERE** clause is used to filter rows.

## ORDER BY Clause

The **ORDER BY** clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It is used to specify the order in which the result set should be displayed. The **ORDER BY** clause is commonly used with the **SELECT** statement.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
ORDER BY
  emp_salary DESC;
```

> **Note:** The **ORDER BY** clause can be used to sort the result set in ascending (**ASC**) or descending (**DESC**) order. by default, it sorts in ascending order.

## LIMIT Clause

The **LIMIT** clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query. It is used to restrict the number of rows in the result set. The **LIMIT** clause is commonly used with the **SELECT** statement.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
LIMIT
  10;
```

## OFFSET Clause

The **OFFSET** clause is used to skip a specified number of rows before returning the result set. It is used in conjunction with the **LIMIT** clause to implement pagination. The **OFFSET** clause is commonly used with the **SELECT** statement.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
LIMIT
  10 OFFSET 20;
```
