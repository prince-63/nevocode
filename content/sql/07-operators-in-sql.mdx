# Operators in SQL

Operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on one or more operands in SQL. They are used to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operations in SQL queries.

Here are some of the commonly used operators in SQL:

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data. The following are the arithmetic operators in SQL:

### Addition (+)

The addition operator (+) is used to add two values together.

```sql
SELECT 10 + 5;
```

### Subtraction (-)

The subtraction operator (-) is used to subtract one value from another.

```sql
SELECT 10 - 5;
```

### Multiplication (*)

The multiplication operator (*) is used to multiply two values.

```sql
SELECT 10 * 5;
```

### Division (/)

The division operator (/) is used to divide one value by another.

```sql
SELECT 10 / 5;
```

### Modulus (%)

The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.

```sql
SELECT 10 % 3;
```

## 2. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. The following are the comparison operators in SQL:

### Equal to (=)

Checks if two values are equal.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary = 50000;
```

### Not equal to (!= or &lt;&gt;)

Checks if two values are not equal.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary != 50000;
```

### Greater than (>)

Checks if one value is greater than another.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > 50000;
```

### Less than (&lt;)

Checks if one value is less than another.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary < 50000;
```

### Greater than or equal to (>=)

Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary >= 50000;
```

### Less than or equal to (&lt;=)

Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary <= 50000;
```

## 3. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions. The following are the logical operators in SQL:

### AND

Returns true if both conditions are true.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > 50000
  AND emp_dept = 'IT';
```

### OR

Returns true if at least one condition is true.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > 50000
  OR emp_dept = 'IT';
```

### NOT

Returns true if the condition is false.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  NOT emp_dept = 'IT';
```

## 4. String Operators

String operators are used to perform operations on string values. The following are the string operators in SQL:

### Concatenation (||)

Concatenates two strings.

```sql
SELECT
  first_name || ' ' || last_name
FROM
  employees;
```

## 5. Other Operators

### LIKE

Used to search for a specified pattern in a column.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  first_name LIKE 'J%';
```

### IN

Used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_dept IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');
```

### BETWEEN

Used to search for a range of values.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary BETWEEN 40000
  AND 60000;
```

### IS NULL

Used to check if a value is NULL.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_manager IS NULL;
```

### IS NOT NULL

Used to check if a value is not NULL.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_manager IS NOT NULL;
```

### EXISTS

Used to check if a subquery returns any rows.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  EXISTS (
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      departments
    WHERE
      employees.emp_dept = departments.dept_name
  );
```

### ALL

Used to compare a value to all values in a list.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > ALL (50000, 60000, 70000);
```

### ANY

Used to compare a value to any value in a list.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > ANY (50000, 60000, 70000);
```

### SOME

Used to compare a value to some values in a list.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  emp_salary > SOME (50000, 60000, 70000);
```
