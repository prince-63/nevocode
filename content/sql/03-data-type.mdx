# SQL Data Types

In SQL, data types are used to define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a table. Each column in a table is associated with a specific data type that determines the kind of values that can be stored in that column. Understanding data types is essential for designing efficient and well-structured databases.

## Common Data Types in SQL

SQL supports a wide range of data types that can be broadly categorized into the following groups:

- **Numeric Data Types**: Used to store numeric values such as integers, decimals, and floating-point numbers.
- **String Data Types**: Used to store character strings such as text and alphanumeric values.
- **Date/Time Data Types**: Used to store date and time values.
- **Special Data Types**: Used to store special values such as binary data, JSON, and XML.

Let's explore each of these data types in more detail.

## Numeric Data Types

Numeric data types are used to store numeric values such as integers, decimals, and floating-point numbers. The most common numeric data types in SQL include:

- **INT**: Used to store whole numbers (integers) within a specific range.
- **DECIMAL**: Used to store fixed-point numbers with a specified precision and scale.
- **FLOAT**: Used to store floating-point numbers with a specified precision.
- **DOUBLE**: Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers.

Here is an example of defining a column with a numeric data type in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    quantity INT
);
```

In this example, the `price` column is defined as a `DECIMAL` data type with a precision of 10 digits and a scale of 2 decimal places, while the `quantity` column is defined as an `INT` data type to store whole numbers.

## String Data types

String data types are used to store character strings such as text and alphanumeric values. The most common string data types in SQL include:

- **CHAR**: Used to store fixed-length character strings.
- **VARCHAR**: Used to store variable-length character strings.
- **TEXT**: Used to store large text values.

Here is an example of defining a column with a string data type in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    address TEXT
);
```

In this example, the `name` and `email` columns are defined as `VARCHAR` data types with a maximum length of 50 and 100 characters, respectively, while the `address` column is defined as a `TEXT` data type to store large text values.

## Date/Time Data types

Date/Time data types are used to store date and time values. The most common date/time data types in SQL include:

- **DATE**: Used to store date values in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

- **TIME**: Used to store time values in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

- **DATETIME**: Used to store date and time values in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

Here is an example of defining a column with a date/time data type in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    delivery_time TIME,
    created_at DATETIME
);
```

In this example, the `order_date` column is defined as a `DATE` data type to store date values, the `delivery_time` column is defined as a `TIME` data type to store time values, and the `created_at` column is defined as a `DATETIME` data type to store date and time values.

## Special Data types

Special data types are used to store special values such as binary data, JSON, and XML. Some common special data types in SQL include:

- **BLOB**: Used to store binary large objects such as images and multimedia files.
- **JSON**: Used to store JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.
- **XML**: Used to store XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data.

Here is an example of defining a column with a special data type in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    content BLOB,
    metadata JSON,
    config XML
);
```

In this example, the `content` column is defined as a `BLOB` data type to store binary data, the `metadata` column is defined as a `JSON` data type to store JSON data, and the `config` column is defined as an `XML` data type to store XML data.
