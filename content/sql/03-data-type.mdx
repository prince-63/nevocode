# SQL Data Types

In SQL, data types are used to define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a table. Each column in a table is associated with a specific data type that determines the kind of values that can be stored in that column. Understanding data types is essential for designing efficient and well-structured databases.

## Common Data Types in SQL

SQL supports a wide range of data types that can be broadly categorized into the following groups:

- **Numeric Data Types**: Used to store numeric values such as integers, decimals, and floating-point numbers.
- **String Data Types**: Used to store character strings such as text and alphanumeric values.
- **Date/Time Data Types**: Used to store date and time values.
- **Special Data Types**: Used to store special values such as binary data, JSON, and XML.

Let's explore each of these data types in more detail.

### Numeric Data Types

- **INT**: Used to store whole numbers (integers) within a specific range.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the quantity is an integer
  quantity INT
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and quantity = 10
 the quantity is stored as 10
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, quantity)
VALUES
  (1, 10);
```

- **DECIMAL**: Used to store fixed-point numbers with a specified precision and scale.
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  /*
   the price is a decimal number 
   with 10 digits and 2 decimal places
   */
  price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and price = 19.99
 the price is stored as 19.99
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, price)
VALUES
  (1, 19.99);
```

- **FLOAT**: Used to store floating-point numbers with a specified precision.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the weight is a floating-point number
  weight FLOAT
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and weight = 2.5
 the weight is stored as 2.5
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, weight)
VALUES
  (1, 2.5);
```

- **DOUBLE**: Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers.
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the value is a double-precision floating-point number
  value DOUBLE
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and value = 123.45
 the value is stored as 123.45
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, value)
VALUES
  (1, 123.45);
```

### String Data types

- **CHAR**: Used to store fixed-length character strings.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  /*
   the name is a fixed-length string 
   with a maximum length of 50 characters
   */
  name CHAR(50)
);

/*
 inserting a customer with
 id = 1 and name = 'John'
 the name is stored as 'John__________' (padded with spaces)
 */
INSERT INTO
  customers (id, name)
VALUES
  (1, 'John');
```

> **Note:** whenever you define a **CHAR** data type, it will always store the fixed length of characters. If you store a string with fewer characters, it will pad the remaining characters with spaces. like if you store a string 'John' in a **CHAR(10)** column, it will be stored as 'John--------' (padded with spaces).

- **VARCHAR**: Used to store variable-length character strings.
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  /*
   the email is a variable-length string
   with a maximum length of 100 characters
   */
  email VARCHAR(100)
);

/*
 inserting a customer with
 id = 1 and email = 'hello@gmail.com'
 the email is stored as 'hello@gmail.com'
 */
INSERT INTO
  customers (id, email)
VALUES
  (1, 'hello@gmail.com');
```

> **Note:** **VARCHAR** data type is used when you want to store a string with a variable length. It will only store the actual length of the string without any padding. For example, if you store a string 'John' in a **VARCHAR(10)** column, it will be stored as 'John' (without any padding).

- **TEXT**: Used to store large text values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the address is a large text value
  address TEXT
);

/*
 inserting a customer with
 id = 1 and address = '123 Main Street, City, Country'
 the address is stored as '123 Main Street, City, Country'
 */
INSERT INTO
  customers (id, address)
VALUES
  (1, '123 Main Street, City, Country');
```

### Date/Time Data types

- **DATE**: Used to store date values in the format **YYYY-MM-DD**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  /*
   the order_date is a date value
   format: YYYY-MM-DD
   */
  order_date DATE
);

/*
 inserting an order with
 id = 1 and order_date = '2022-10-15'
 the order_date is stored as '2022-10-15'
 */
INSERT INTO
  orders (id, order_date)
VALUES
  (1, '2022-10-15');
```

- **TIME**: Used to store time values in the format **HH:MM:SS**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  /*
   the delivery_time is a time value
   format: HH:MM:SS
   */
  delivery_time TIME
);

/*
 inserting an order with
 id = 1 and delivery_time = '14:30:00'
 the delivery_time is stored as '14:30:00'
 */
INSERT INTO
  orders (id, delivery_time)
VALUES
  (1, '14:30:00');
```

- **DATETIME**: Used to store date and time values in the format **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  /*
   the created_at is a date and time value
   format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
   */
  created_at DATETIME
);

/*
 inserting an order with
 id = 1 and created_at = '2022-10-15
 the created_at is stored as '2022-10-15 14:30:00'
 */
INSERT INTO
  orders (id, created_at)
VALUES
  (1, '2022-10-15 14:30:00');
```

### Special Data types
- **BLOB**: Used to store binary large objects such as images and multimedia files.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the image is a binary large object
  image BLOB
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and image = 'binary data'
 the image is stored as 'binary data'
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, image)
VALUES
  (1, 'binary data');
```

- **JSON**: Used to store JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the details is JSON data
  details JSON
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and details = '{"name": "Product 1", "price": 19.99}'
 the details are stored as '{"name": "Product 1", "price": 19.99}'
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, details)
VALUES
  (1, '{"name": "Product 1", "price": 19.99}');
```

- **XML**: Used to store XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- the description is XML data
  description XML
);

/*
 inserting a product with
 id = 1 and description = '<product><name>Product 1</name><price>19.99</price></product>'
 the description is stored as '<product><name>Product 1</name><price>19.99</price></product>'
 */
INSERT INTO
  products (id, description)
VALUES
  (
    1,
    '<product><name>Product 1</name><price>19.99</price></product>'
  );
```
