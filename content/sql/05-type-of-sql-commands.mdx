# Type of SQL Commands

In SQL (Structured Query Language), there are several types of commands that are used to interact with a database. These commands can be broadly classified into the following categories:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** 
3. **Data Query Language (DQL)**
4. **Data Control Language (DCL)**
5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**

Let's discuss each of these categories in detail:

## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

Data Definition Language (DDL) commands are used to define the structure of the database. These commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, etc. Some common DDL commands include:

- **CREATE**: Used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, views, etc.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

- **ALTER**: Used to modify the structure of existing database objects.
    
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN emp_dept VARCHAR(50);
```

- **DROP**: Used to delete database objects.

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

- **TRUNCATE**: Used to remove all the records from a table.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are used to manipulate the data stored in the database. These commands are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from the database. Some common DML commands include:

- **INSERT**: Used to insert new records into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 50000);
```

- **UPDATE**: Used to update existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE employees SET emp_salary = 55000 WHERE emp_id = 1;
```

- **DELETE**: Used to delete records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 1;
```

- **SELECT**: Used to retrieve data from a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

## 3. Data Query Language (DQL)

Data Query Language (DQL) commands are used to retrieve data from the database. The most common DQL command is the **SELECT** statement, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on certain conditions.

```sql
SELECT emp_name, emp_salary FROM employees WHERE emp_salary > 50000;
```

## 4. Data Control Language (DCL)

Data Control Language (DCL) commands are used to control access to the database. These commands are used to grant or revoke privileges to users and roles. Some common DCL commands include:

- **GRANT**: Used to grant privileges to users or roles.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO
    user1, user2;
```

- **REVOKE**: Used to revoke privileges from users or roles.

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON employees FROM user1;
```

## 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)

Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These commands are used to control the changes made by DML commands. Some common TCL commands include:

- **COMMIT**: Used to save the changes made by DML commands.

```sql
COMMIT;
```

- **ROLLBACK**: Used to undo the changes made by DML commands.

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

- **SAVEPOINT**: Used to set a savepoint within a transaction.

```sql
SAVEPOINT sp1;
```

These are the different types of SQL commands that are used to interact with a database. Understanding these commands is essential for working with databases effectively.
