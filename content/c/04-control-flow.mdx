# Control Flow in C üö¶

Programming is all about making decisions and repeating tasks efficiently. Imagine you're planning a road trip. You decide when to take a turn, whether to stop for fuel, or if you need to keep driving based on different conditions. Similarly, in C, we use **control flow statements** to make decisions and repeat actions.

## Conditional Statements üåü
Conditional statements allow your program to take different actions based on conditions.

## The if Statement Making Decisions
The `if` statement helps the program decide whether to execute a block of code.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fuel = 10;
    if (fuel > 5) {
        printf("Enough fuel, let's keep driving!"); 
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

**Explanation:** If `fuel` is greater than 5, the message "Enough fuel, let's keep driving!" is printed.

## The if-else Statement Choosing Between Two Options
What if the fuel is low? We use `if-else` to handle both situations.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fuel = 3;
    if (fuel > 5) {
        printf("Enough fuel, let's keep driving!");
    } else {
        printf("Low fuel! Time to refuel.");
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## The if-else-if Ladder Multiple Conditions
Sometimes, we need to check multiple conditions before deciding.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int temperature = 25;
    if (temperature > 30) {
        printf("It's too hot!");
    } else if (temperature > 20) {
        printf("Nice and warm.");
    } else {
        printf("It's cold! Wear a jacket.");
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## The switch Statement Handling Multiple Cases
If you have multiple choices (like a restaurant menu), `switch` makes it cleaner.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int day = 3;
    switch (day) {
        case 1: printf("Monday"); break;
        case 2: printf("Tuesday"); break;
        case 3: printf("Wednesday"); break;
        default: printf("Invalid day!");
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## Loops üîÅ Repeating Tasks
Loops help repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it manually.

## The for Loop Counting Repetitions
Imagine counting 1 to 5:

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Counting: %d", i);
    }
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## The while Loop Repeat Until a Condition is Met
Think of a car moving until it runs out of fuel.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fuel = 5;
    while (fuel > 0) {
        printf("Driving... Fuel left: %d", fuel);
        fuel--;
    }
    printf("Out of fuel!");
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

## The `do-while` Loop ‚Äì Run at Least Once
A vending machine always gives one attempt before checking if money was inserted.

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int attempts = 1;
    do {
        printf("Attempt %d: Trying to enter the password...", attempts);
        attempts++;
    } while (attempts <= 3);
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>
