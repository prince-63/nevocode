# Operators in C ⚡

Operators in C are **symbols** that perform operations on variables and values. Think of them as the tools a programmer uses to manipulate data and perform calculations.

## Types of Operators in C 🛠️

C provides several types of operators, each serving a unique purpose:

- **Arithmetic Operators** 🧮 (For mathematical calculations)
- **Relational Operators** 🔄 (To compare values)
- **Logical Operators** 🔍 (To combine conditions)
- **Bitwise Operators** ⚡ (To work at the bit level)
- **Assignment Operators** 📝 (To assign values)
- **Unary Operators** (To modify a single value)
- **Ternary Operator** 🎭 (A shortcut for conditions)
- **Increment and Decrement Operators** (To increase or decrease values)

### **1. Arithmetic Operators 🧮**

Imagine you're splitting a pizza 🍕 with friends. You need to divide slices equally, check how many remain, or multiply orders. Arithmetic operators help with such tasks:

- `+` Addition: Combines two values → `a + b`
- `-` Subtraction: Finds the difference → `a - b`
- `*` Multiplication: Multiplies numbers → `a * b`
- `/` Division: Divides values → `a / b`
- `%` Modulus: Gives the remainder → `a % b`

**Example:**

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 3;
    printf("Sum: %d", a + b); // output-> Sum: 13
    printf("Difference: %d", a - b); // output-> Difference: 7
    printf("Product: %d", a * b); // output-> Product: 30
    printf("Quotient: %d", a / b); // output-> Quotient: 3
    printf("Remainder: %d", a % b); // output-> Remainder: 1
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

### **2. Relational Operators 🔄**

Think of a race 🏁. You need to check who finished first, whether two players had the same time, or if one took longer. Relational operators help with comparisons:

- `==` Equal to → `a == b` (Checks if values are the same)
- `!=` Not equal to → `a != b` (Checks if values are different)
- `>` Greater than → `a > b`
- `<` Less than → `a < b`
- `>=` Greater than or equal to → `a >= b`
- `<=` Less than or equal to → `a <= b`

### **3. Logical Operators 🔍**

Imagine setting up a security system. The alarm should ring if **either** the front door or back door is open, but only if someone is inside. Logical operators help handle such conditions:

- `&&` Logical AND → `a && b` (Both must be true)
- `||` Logical OR → `a || b` (At least one must be true)
- `!` Logical NOT → `!a` (Reverses the condition)

**Example:**

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 1, b = 0;
    printf("AND: %d", a & b); // output-> AND: 0
    printf("OR: %d", a | b); // output-> OR: 1
    printf("NOT: %d", !a);  // output-> NOT: 0
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

### **4. Bitwise Operators ⚡**

Bitwise operators work at the **bit level**, meaning they operate directly on binary values (0s and 1s). Think of them like electrical switches. Useful in low-level programming, they include:

- `&` Bitwise AND → `a & b`
- `|` Bitwise OR → `a | b`
- `^` Bitwise XOR → `a ^ b`
- `~` Bitwise NOT → `~a`
- `<<` Left Shift → `a << 2`
- `>>` Right Shift → `a >> 2`

### **5. Assignment Operators 📝**

Assignment operators are like a **delivery service**—they take a value and store it in a variable.

- `=` Assigns → `a = 10`
- `+=` Adds and assigns → `a += 5` (same as `a = a + 5`)
- `-=` Subtracts and assigns → `a -= 5`
- `*=` Multiplies and assigns → `a *= 5`
- `/=` Divides and assigns → `a /= 5`
- `%=` Modulus and assigns → `a %= 5`

### **6. Unary Operators**

Unary operators work on a **single value**, modifying it:

- `+` Unary plus → `+a`
- `-` Unary minus → `-a`
- `++` Increment → `++a` or `a++`
- `--` Decrement → `--a` or `a--`

**Example:**

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    printf("Pre-increment: %d", ++a); // output-> Pre-increment: 6
    printf("Post-increment: %d", a++); // output-> Post-increment: 6 
    printf("Value after post-increment: %d", a); // output-> Value after post-increment: 7
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>

### **7. Ternary Operator 🎭**

Think of a shortcut for making decisions. The ternary operator works like an `if-else` but in one line:

**Syntax:**

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;`
}
</CodeBlock>

**Example:**

<CodeBlock language="c">
{
`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
    printf("Max value is: %d", max); // output-> Max value is: 20
    return 0;
}`
}
</CodeBlock>
