# Time & Space Complexity

Your are planning a trip to the moon and you need to pack your bags. You have a list of items that you want to take with you. You have a limited amount of space in your bag and you want to make sure that you can fit everything in it. You also want to make sure that you can carry your bag without it being too heavy. You need to decide which items to take with you and which items to leave behind.

This is a common problem that we face in our everyday lives. We need to make decisions about how to use our resources efficiently. In computer science, we also need to make decisions about how to use our resources efficiently. We need to make sure that our algorithms are efficient in terms of time and space.

## What is Time Complexity?

Time complexity is noting but the amount of time an algorithm takes to run. It is a measure of how much time an algorithm takes to complete its task. Time complexity is usually measured in terms of the number of operations that an algorithm performs. 

The time complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using Big-O notation. Big-O notation is a way of describing the upper bound on the running time of an algorithm. It gives us an idea of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input grows.

### Common Time Complexities

| Notation | Name |
|----------|------|
| O(1)     | Constant Time |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic Time |
| O(n)     | Linear Time |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic Time |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic Time |
| O(2^n) | Exponential Time |
| O(n!) | Factorial Time |

## Space Complexity

Space complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses. It is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses to complete its task. Space complexity is usually measured in terms of the number of memory cells that an algorithm uses.

The space complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using Big-O notation. Big-O notation is a way of describing the upper bound on the amount of memory that an algorithm uses. It gives us an idea of how the memory usage of an algorithm grows as the size of the input grows.

> This time you don't have to think much about time and space complexities, just understand the concept. When you get experience in software development you will automatically start thinking about time and space complexity.

## Why should we care about Time & Space Complexity?

Imagine a senario where you have to sort a list of 1 million numbers. You have two way to do it. One way you can able to do in 10 steps and other way you can do it in 1000 steps. Which one you will choose?

Of course, you will choose the one which takes less steps. This is why we care about time complexity. We want to make sure that our algorithms are efficient in terms of time. We want to make sure that our algorithms run as fast as possible.
